Project Description

A clean, responsive weight Conversion application built with React JS. This tool allows users to convert values between kilograms and pounds in real-time, delivering a smooth and interactive experience for accurate measurements.



Features

Bi-Directional Conversion: Users can convert values from kilograms to pounds and vice versa by entering values in either input field.
Real-Time Updates: Conversion happens instantly as the user types, without the need for any buttons.
Automatic Clearing: If one input field is cleared, the corresponding field is also cleared automatically.
Precision Conversion: Converted values are rounded to two decimal places for accuracy.
Simple and Clean UI: Minimalistic design with labeled input fields and placeholders for guidance.
Responsive Design: Works efficiently across different devices and screen sizes.



Implementation

HTML / JSX Structure
The project is structured using React JSX. It consists of a main container holding a conversion block with two labeled input fields—one for kilograms and one for pounds. Each input field is connected to an onChange event that triggers the conversion logic.


React State Management
React’s useState hook is used to manage the kilograms (kg) and pounds (lb) state values. Updating the state instantly triggers a UI re-render, ensuring that conversions are displayed in real-time.


Conversion Logic
Two functions handle bi-directional conversion:
ConvertToLb: Converts kilograms to pounds by multiplying the input value by 2.20462. If the input is empty, the pounds field is cleared.
ConvertToKg: Converts pounds to kilograms by multiplying the input value by 0.456. If the input is empty, the kilograms field is cleared.4


Real-Time UI Updates
As the user types in either field, the corresponding value updates instantly without page reloads. This ensures a seamless and interactive user experience with accurate and immediate conversions.
