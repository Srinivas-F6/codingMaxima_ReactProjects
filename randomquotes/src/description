Implementation:


React Component Structure
The project is implemented using a single React functional component. The component imports a predefined collection of motivational quotes stored as strings from an external file. The UI consists of a button to generate quotes and a section that dynamically displays the selected quotes.

State Management
React’s useState hook is used to manage the quotes displayed on the screen. The state variable stores an array of randomly selected quotes, allowing multiple quotes to be rendered at once. Whenever the state updates, React automatically re-renders the UI.

Random Quote Generation Logic
When the user clicks the Get Quotes button, the handleQuotes function executes. Inside this function, a loop runs five times to randomly select quotes from the predefined quotes array. Each quote is selected using Math.random() and added to a temporary array, which is then stored in the component’s state.

Dynamic Rendering of Quotes
The application uses conditional rendering to display quotes only when the state array contains data. The map() function is used to iterate over the quotes array and render each quote inside a paragraph element. Each rendered quote is assigned a unique key to ensure efficient rendering.

Event Handling
The button click event is handled using React’s onClick event. This triggers the quote generation logic without refreshing the page, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

User Experience and Performance
The application provides instant feedback by displaying quotes immediately after the button is clicked. The simple structure and efficient state updates ensure fast performance and clean UI behavior.
