Project Description

A visually appealing, responsive Digital Clock application built using React JS. The clock displays the current time in real-time and allows users to toggle between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats, delivering a smooth and interactive experience.


Features

Real-Time Clock: Continuously updates the current time every second using setInterval.
12-Hour and 24-Hour Formats: Users can switch between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats with dedicated buttons.
Dynamic Styling: The clock is displayed in a styled container with background, shadows, and hover effects for visual appeal.
Responsive Layout: The interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and maintains readability.
Clean and Interactive UI: Buttons and time display have hover and active effects for better user experience.
Automatic Time Formatting: Hours, minutes, and seconds are padded to always display two digits for consistency.


Implementation

HTML / JSX Structure
The application uses React JSX to render the clock and format toggle buttons. A container holds the time display and buttons, styled dynamically using CSS-in-JS.

Styling
CSS is used to create a visually appealing interface. The container has padding, border-radius, background color, shadow effects, and hover animations. Buttons are styled with hover and active effects, and the background includes a clock image with gradient overlay for better readability.


React State Management
React’s useState hook manages the current time (current) and the selected time format (t24). The state updates every second using useEffect with setInterval.

Real-Time Time Update Logic
useEffect sets up an interval that updates the current state every 1000 milliseconds. On component unmount, the interval is cleared to prevent memory leaks.

12-Hour and 24-Hour Format Logic
The application checks the t24 state to determine which format to display. In 12-hour mode, it calculates AM/PM and converts hours appropriately. In 24-hour mode, hours are displayed directly.

User Interaction
Clicking the 12 Hours or 24 Hours button updates the t24 state. This triggers React to re-render the component with the selected format immediately, providing an interactive and responsive experience.


Real-Time UI Updates
The time display updates every second in real-time, and any format changes reflect immediately without page reload. This ensures a smooth and accurate clock experience for the user.
