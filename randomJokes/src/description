project description:

A Random Jokes Generator is a React JS application that fetches random jokes from a public API and displays them dynamically on the screen. Each time the user interacts with the app, five new jokes are loaded instantly without refreshing the page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

features:


API-Based Joke Fetching: Retrieves random jokes dynamically from a public API.
Redux Toolkit State Management: Uses Redux Toolkit to manage global state for jokes, loading, and error handling.
Async Actions with Thunks: Implements createAsyncThunk for handling asynchronous API calls efficiently.
Centralized Store: Maintains jokes data in a single Redux store for better scalability and maintainability.
Real-Time UI Updates: Automatically updates the UI when Redux state changes without page reloads.
Loading & Error Handling: Displays appropriate messages during API loading or failure scenarios.
Clean and Simple UI: Minimal and user-friendly interface for better readability.

Implementation:

Application Architecture
The project is built using React for the front-end and Redux Toolkit for state management. Redux handles joke data and loading states centrally, making the app scalable and organized.

Redux Toolkit – Async API Integration
createAsyncThunk is used to fetch jokes asynchronously from a public API using Axios. This ensures that API requests and data handling are efficiently managed in one place.

Redux Slice Implementation
A Redux slice defines the initial state with joke data and loading status. The extraReducers handle the pending and fulfilled states of the async API call to update the state accordingly.

React Component Logic
useDispatch is used to trigger the getjokes async action, while useSelector accesses the jokes and loading state. Clicking the Get Joke button dispatches the API call and updates the UI.

Conditional Rendering
The UI displays a loading message while the API fetch is in progress. Once the jokes are available, they are dynamically rendered based on their type—single-line or two-part jokes.

Real-Time Updates and User Interaction
When the Redux state updates, React automatically re-renders the UI without any page reloads. Users can instantly see new jokes every time they click the button.

Performance and Best Practices
The project follows best practices such as centralized state management and separation of concerns. Using Redux Toolkit ensures maintainable, scalable, and optimized code.
