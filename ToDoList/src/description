Implementation:

HTML / JSX Structure
The project’s structure is built using React JSX. It consists of a main container that holds a to-do box. Inside the to-do box, there is a heading for the title, an input section containing a text input and an Add button, followed by a list that displays all added names. Each list item includes action buttons for deleting the item and moving it up or down in the list.


Styling
The project uses CSS for styling to create a clean and user-friendly interface. The main container centers the to-do box on the screen. The to-do box has padding, a background color, rounded corners, and spacing to improve visual appearance. Buttons are styled uniformly, and the layout is responsive, making the application usable on different screen sizes.


React State Management
React’s useState hook is used to manage application state. One state variable stores the list of names, while another stores the current value entered in the input field. Updating the state automatically re-renders the UI, ensuring real-time updates without page reloads.


Adding Items Logic
When the user types a name into the input field, the input state updates instantly. Clicking the Add button appends the new name to the existing list using a new array copy, maintaining immutability. After adding, the input field is cleared to improve user experience.


Deleting Items Logic
Each list item includes a Delete button. When clicked, the corresponding item is removed from the list using the filter() method based on its index. This creates a new updated list and reflects the change immediately in the UI.

Move Up and Move Down Logic
The application allows reordering of items using Move Up and Move Down buttons. When Move Up is clicked, the selected item swaps positions with the item above it, provided it is not already at the top. Similarly, the Move Down button swaps the item with the one below it, ensuring it does not exceed list boundaries. This logic uses array copying and destructuring to maintain React’s immutability principle.

Real-Time UI Updates
All operations such as adding, deleting, and reordering items update the list instantly. React’s state-driven rendering ensures that changes appear immediately without any manual DOM manipulation.
